Balanced mix design (BMD) is an enhanced approach to designing asphalt paving mixtures to achieve a satisfactory balance between rutting resistance and cracking resistance.

Eligibility: These workshops are designed for state highway agency materials engineers who are typically decision makers on mix design and acceptance specifications, asphalt industry mangers responsible for asphalt mix designs and quality control testing, and other stakeholders interested in gaining an understanding of balanced mix design.
