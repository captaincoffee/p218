**Abstract**: One of the most common methods used to treat longitudinal and transverse cracks is crack sealing (CS), which is categorized as a preventive maintenance method. Field performance and cost-effectiveness of this treatment widely vary depending on pavement conditions and installation of the material. The objective of this study was to evaluate the field performance and cost-effectiveness of CS in flexible and composite pavements in hot and wet climates such as Louisiana, and to develop a model that would quantify the expected benefits of CS given project conditions.<!--more--> To achieve this objective, 28 control sections that were crack-sealed between 2003 and 2010 were monitored for at least four years. These sections included flexible and composite pavements, sealed and unsealed segments, and varying traffic levels. The performance of these sections was evaluated for the random cracking index (RCI) and roughness index (RI). Based on the results of this analysis, it was concluded that CS only has a significant impact on random cracking. When compared with untreated segments, CS extended pavement service life (PSL) by two years. When compared with the original pavement, CS extended PSL by 5.6 and 3.2 years for flexible and composite pavements, respectively, if applied at the correct time. The cost-benefit analysis indicated that CS is cost-effective whether asphalt emulsion or rubberized asphalt sealant is used. A non-linear regression model was developed to predict the extension in PSL because of CS without the need for performance data based on the average daily traffic (ADT), pavement type, and prior pavement conditions.

Surface cracking in asphalt concrete (AC) is a major failure mechanism that develops over the pavement service life (PSL). Cracks are typically categorized into alligator, block, longitudinal, and transverse cracks. These cracks are primarily caused by traffic loading, thermal stress, and aging (1). It is well recognized that water infiltration through cracks may accelerate pavement deterioration, resulting in major problems such as stripping, base failure, and potholes (2,3). One of the most common treatments used to control surface cracks is crack sealing (CS), which is categorized as a preventive maintenance method (4).

Crack sealing is a surface treatment technique where hot-poured bituminous-based materials are applied into transverse and longitudinal cracks using various configurations (5,6). Field performance of CS is commonly evaluated for failure exhibited by the sealant material. Sealant failures result from excessive stresses in the sealant as the crack opens and closes with temperature variation and traffic loading. These failure mechanisms can be attributed to improper material selection or neglecting one or more of the construction considerations (7). Common sealant failures include adhesion loss, cohesion loss, spalls, pullout, extrusive, and intrusive failures (7,8).

Crack sealing has received considerable interest in Louisiana in recent years. The selection and construction processes for CS has been well researched and documented in previous studies (9â€“15). Yet, fewer studies were conducted to assess field performance of CS, especially in hot and wet climates such as Louisiana. Therefore, factors that may affect the field performance of CS should be evaluated and quantified to ensure that the treatment is only used when positive benefits are expected. This would also allow quantifying cost-effectiveness of this treatment method in controlling cracks and enhancing PSL.
