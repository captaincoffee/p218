The overall objective of the demonstration project was to achieve increased in-place density for asphalt pavements. There were two major components of this study, including (1) a literature search to serve as an educational component for the best practices for increasing in-place density; and (2) the construction of 10 field demonstration projects. The field demonstration projects were constructed in 10 states whose participation was selected through an application process. Each of the SHAs and contractors involved in the field demonstration projects were offered a workshop from the Asphalt Institute (AI) and FHWA and on-site assistance during construction from the National Center for Asphalt Technology (NCAT).

Each field demonstration project included a control and one or more test sections. The control section was built by the contractor to achieve the required in-place density based on their routine construction practices. At least one test section was built as part of the agreement with FHWA, and the goal of this section was to use improved paving and compaction techniques to increase density. The contractor was encouraged to employ techniques that did not require additional rollers or a higher asphalt content that would result in significantly increased cost. In some states, additional test sections were constructed by the SHAs and contractors to evaluate other techniques, which generally included additional rollers to improve density or other ideas of interest that they believed would work best in their local state.
