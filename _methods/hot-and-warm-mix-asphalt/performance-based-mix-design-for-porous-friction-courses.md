The Transportation Research Board has released NCHRP Research Report 877, **Performance-Based Mix Design for Porous Friction Courses**.
<!--more-->

Porous Friction Courses (PFC) have been used for some time to provide safe driving surfaces. The open graded mixtures channel water from the road, and reducing splashing and spray from standing water. The surface texture also provides increased skid resistance. This report provides a detailed overview of Porous Friction Courses, their distresses, as well as mix design methods which are correlated to field performance.

This report will be of interest to Materials Engineers and technicians of Highway Agencies and Industry.
