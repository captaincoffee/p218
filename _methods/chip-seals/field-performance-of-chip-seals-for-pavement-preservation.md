The objective of this study was to evaluate the field performance of chip seal test sections placed on a low traffic volume road. To accomplish this objective, full-scale test sections were treated with chip seal applications and their performance monitored periodically over a 4.5-year period.

**Abstract**: Over time, new pavements deteriorate due to the effect of traffic loads and the environment. If appropriate treatments are applied during the early stages of deterioration, it is possible to extend the service life of the pavement without incurring in costly rehabilitation or reconstruction activities. Chip seals are preservation treatments that can help protect the pavement structure, reduce the rate of pavement deterioration, improve skid resistance, and address minor surface problems. As part of the National Center for Asphalt Technology Pavement Preservation Study, chip seal test sections were placed in a low traffic volume road (Lee County Road 159) in Auburn, Alabama. The location consists of a two-lane county road that provides dead end access to a quarry and an asphalt plant, resulting in a high percentage of heavy loads.
