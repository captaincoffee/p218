The primary purpose of this study is to examine the link between various parameters obtained from a monotonic DST and the results of a cyclic loading test, which more realistically assesses the interface performance. Furthermore, to investigate the possible effect of interface failure mode (shear vs. tensile) on the performance assessment of tack coat interlayers, a simple indirect tensile test (IDT) was conducted to determine the tensile behavior of the interlayers.

**Abstract**: A monotonic direct shear test (DST) is the most commonly used method to evaluate bond strength of interlayers; however, it does not consider the actual repetitive traffic loading that pavement undergoes during its service life. This study aims to examine the link between various parameters obtained from a monotonic DST and the results of a cyclic loading test that more realistically assesses the interlayer performance with tack coats. Furthermore, to investigate the possible effect of the interface failure mode (shear vs. tensile) on the performance assessment of the tack coat interlayers, a simple indirect tensile test was conducted to determine the tensile strength of the interlayers.
