"AASHTO is a wonderful place to work," said Wright upon announcing his retirement. "In my experience – and that experience working in transportation now spans more than 43 years – you will at some point feel the moment. And I am feeling that moment. This is very bittersweet for me, but I am proud of where we are as an association and I prefer the idea of leaving maybe too soon rather than too late."
