The objective of this paper is to develop a post-thin-overlay IRI prediction model using a unified model function form, which can be used for different regions. The influence of thin overlay was characterized by several factors such as structural strength, annual precipitation, etc. An IRI prediction method was proposed based on the analysis of influence factors, and findings from this work can provide the guideline for other performance indictors or treatments.

**Abstract**: Pavement performance prediction after maintenance and rehabilitation is important to pavement management. A two-parameter exponential international roughness index (IRI) regression model for thin hot mix asphalt overlay was developed based on information from the U.S. Long Term Pavement Performance (LTPP) database. The model influence parameters α and β, which represent the initial IRI as the thin overlay completion and shape factor of IRI deterioration curve, were statistically analyzed. The results suggested that the IRI deterioration trends in high-temperature and low-temperature regions are different. This is because β was mainly affected by the structural strength and equivalent single axle loads in the high and medium temperature region and mainly affected by the average annual precipitation in low temperature region. In-situ data from LTPP database was used to verify the IRI prediction model, and it was found that the predicted IRI and measured IRI exhibited similar trends.
