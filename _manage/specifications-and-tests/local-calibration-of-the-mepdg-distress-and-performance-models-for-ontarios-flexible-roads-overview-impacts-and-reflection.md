**Abstract**: Built upon a seven-year local calibration study of Ontario’s flexible pavements, this paper provides a summary of the calibration results and design impact and, more importantly, shares the experience and lessons learned from the process. The best results have been achieved on the local calibration of the rutting, bottom-up fatigue cracking, and international roughness index (IRI) distress models minimizing the residual sum of squares (RSS) while maintaining the average bias at zero. Significant efforts have been made to calibrate the other distress models with limited success. A design impact study found that local calibration of the rutting models was very important, whereas the alligator fatigue cracking did not usually govern the design in Ontario, although the global model was found to under-predict the cracking damage. The performance of the calibrated IRI model in the design of heavy traffic freeways for both reconstructed and rehabilitated sections was unsatisfactory and needs further study. The paper also presents several open questions for future research. These include the handling of section-length effects of observed cracking data, the determination of initial IRI, the updating of standard deviation functions and the overall reliability models, and the prioritization of pavement research under the new paradigm of the Mechanistic–Empirical Pavement Design Guide (MEPDG).
