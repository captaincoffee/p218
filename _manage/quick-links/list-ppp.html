Listing of Pavement Preservation Partnerships.
<!--more-->

<h2><a href="https://www.pavementpreservation.org/">The National Center for Pavement Preservation(NCPP)</a></h2>

<p>The following Pavement Preservation Partnerships are regional forums of pavement professionals from State Agencies, Contractors, Suppliers, Academia, Local and Federal Government Officials, all working together to take advantage of the synergy to be gained from sharing information and identifying common issues for further investigation. They provide a forum to share and publicize information describing improvements in research, design, specifications, materials and construction practices, and to promote the benefits of Pavement Preservation through education and application.</p>
