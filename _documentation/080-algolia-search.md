## Why a search engine ?

P2 is a content heavy website. In order to allow users to reach relevant content [ASAP](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ASAP), we decided to use a search engine.

## Solution

We choose to use [Algolia Site Search](https://www.algolia.com/solutions/site-search) over [Google Custom Search Engine (CSE)](https://cse.google.com/cse/) for website, sitesearch360  or any other non tested solutions.

This solution is implemented tanks to :

 - [jekyll-algolia](https://github.com/algolia/jekyll-algolia) for deploy side both local or on netlify
 - [Algolia Instant Search](https://community.algolia.com/instantsearch.js/) for the search User Interface
