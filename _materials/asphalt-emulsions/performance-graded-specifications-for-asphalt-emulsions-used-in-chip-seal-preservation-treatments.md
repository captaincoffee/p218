The objective of this study is to develop proposed EPG specifications for chip seal emulsions.

**Abstract**: This paper details the development of a framework for emulsion performance-grade (EPG) specifications for chip seal treatments. Chip seals are preservation surface treatments that are designed to improve the condition of the pavement surface while mitigating deterioration of the overall pavement structure. Asphalt emulsions used in chip seals often are selected based on factors that are not necessarily related to performance.
